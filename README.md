# Introduction
## What is Machine Learning?
The difference between statistics and machine learning is that 
  - Statistics' aim is to explain the relationship, whereas
  - Machine learning aims to create a prediction based on collected data

## Supervised Learning 
### Linear Regression
Linear regression is the most basic form of learning from data. Most of you who have taken statistic or math papers should have came across this topic frequently. 

Essentially, the idea behind linear regression is that a "line of best fit" is drawn for the collected data, with the main objective of finding a relationship between 2 or more sets of data. An example below

Given a training set, a learning algorithm will generate weights based on collected data. Once the solution has converged, any new input will be passed through the calculated weights and a prediction will be generated.

More details are available on the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) page.

### Classification and Logistic Regression
For classification purposes, e.g. telling whether a picture contains a cat, the output will only take on a small amount of discrete values. An example,
